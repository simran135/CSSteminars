# CSSteminars

We currently have 3 levels of courses. Each lesson is accompanied with a notesheet, an in class python document, in class notability/PDF document, a quiz, and a homework. 

Each course should have 16 lessons (aim to have each class last 8 weeks with 2 lessons a week). 

Check the README's inside of the course folders for detailed information on what each lesson is covering.
